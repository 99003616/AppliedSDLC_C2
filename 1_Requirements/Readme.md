# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## What:

1. Performance tracker is the measurement of student achievement across various academic modules. 

2. Teachers and education officials typically measure achievement using classroom performance, graduation rates and results from standardized tests.


## Why:

1. Continuous tracking of students' progress data helps teachers to make sure that the process of education works according to expectations with no delays or gaps.

2. Having students see their growth and review how it relates to bigger goals increases student investment.


## When:

1. Monitoring of progress should occur after every weekly assessments for monitoring studentâ€™s progress.


## Where:

1. Continuous tracking of students' progress data can be shown to both faculties as well as the students. But the faculty can access the data of complete class while the student can access only his/her data.


## How:

1. The process also helps students internalize knowledge, turning what and how they learn into a well of resources they can use in the future. When students assess their own work, when they identify their own strengths and weaknesses, the likelihood that they will do better next time is greater.
